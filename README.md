# OpenMANET Manager

Manages low level configurations and operations in OpenMANET

## Developer Tools

A DevContainer is included within this repo that will have all of the necessary tooling installed within it.

The protobuf specs are a sub module from [OpenMANET/protobuf](https://github.com/OpenMANET/protobufs). You can generate the protobuf library for go by running `buf generate`.

## Quickstart

Start the devcontainer and run `go build` to get the binary built locally

Further documentation can be found in the [Getting Started](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) doc.
